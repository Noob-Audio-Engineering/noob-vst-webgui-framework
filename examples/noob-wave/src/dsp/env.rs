//! ADSR envelope: linear attack, exponential decay and release.
//!
//! Stages ([`Stage`]):
//!
//! 1. **Attack** — rises linearly from the current value to 1 in
//!    `attack_s` seconds (`1 / (attack × sr)` per sample).
//! 2. **Decay** — falls exponentially towards `sustain` with the
//!    coefficient `exp(-SETTLE / (decay × sr))`, so it is within
//!    `e⁻⁵ ≈ 0.7 %` of the target after `decay_s`; it snaps to the sustain
//!    level once within `1e-4`.
//! 3. **Sustain** — holds `sustain` until note off.
//! 4. **Release** — multiplies by `exp(-SETTLE / (release × sr))` per
//!    sample from wherever the value is (a note off during the attack or
//!    decay releases from that level, no jump), and becomes idle below
//!    `1e-4`.
//!
//! [`Adsr::reset`] drops to idle at 0 immediately; the synth calls it
//! before `note_on` on a stolen voice, so a steal restarts from silence.
//! Everything is per-sample state with precomputed coefficients;
//! [`Adsr::set`] is the only method that does transcendental math, and the
//! synth calls it only when the settings change.
