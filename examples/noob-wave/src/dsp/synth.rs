//! Voices and the synth: wavetable oscillator with unison, sub oscillator,
//! per-voice filter and envelopes, one global LFO.
//!
//! # Voice architecture
//!
//! [`Synth`] owns [`MAX_VOICES`] voice slots. A note claims a free slot, or
//! steals the oldest sounding one when the `poly` limit is reached (see
//! [`Synth::note_on`]). Each voice runs:
//!
//! * up to [`MAX_UNISON`] wavetable oscillators, spread symmetrically in
//!   pitch (`detune` cents between the outermost two) and in the stereo
//!   field (`width`, equal-power panning), summed with a `1/√n` gain so
//!   loudness stays roughly constant with the count;
//! * an optional sine sub oscillator one or two octaves down, mixed into
//!   the mono path;
//! * one [`VoiceFilter`] (mono), driven by cutoff, key tracking, the
//!   filter envelope and the LFO;
//! * two [`Adsr`] envelopes, amplitude and filter; a voice frees itself
//!   when its amplitude envelope goes idle.
//!
//! Stereo is kept with a mid/side trick: the unison oscillators are summed
//! to a mid signal, which goes through the filter, and a side signal, which
//! bypasses it; the output is `mid ± side`. One filter per voice is enough
//! and the stereo spread survives.
//!
//! Glide moves a voice's pitch linearly (in semitones) from the previous
//! note to the new one over `glide_s` seconds. Pitch bend is a global
//! offset in semitones. With `phase_random` each oscillator starts at a
//! random phase, otherwise at zero (deterministic, useful for tests).
//!
//! # Rendering
//!
//! [`Synth::render`] works in control-rate chunks of `CHUNK` (16) samples:
//! per chunk it advances the LFO, updates every active voice's pitch
//! (glide, tuning, LFO, bend), unison increments and pans, mip level,
//! sub increment and filter coefficients; then it renders the chunk at
//! audio rate. Coefficient updates every 16 samples keep the filter cheap
//! while modulation still sounds smooth.
//!
//! # Real-time rules
//!
//! Everything except [`Synth::new`] runs on the audio thread: no
//! allocation, no locking, no I/O. [`Settings`] is `Copy` and compared by
//! value, so a host can hand a fresh snapshot to [`Synth::configure`] every
//! block for free.
